# A circularity accounting model for CO2: Artificial neural networks for estimating CO2 values in observation of planetary boundaries.

We methodologically explore the applicability of artificial neural networks in the development of a CO2 estimator and a CO2 production-consumption chain predictor, in order to reassess the use of CO2 across global supply chains. Prior literature has pointed to the need for the advancement, development and operationalization of the circular economy. We present the potential of individual-based accounting as a means to achieving that goal under the lens of Latour views on promoting individual empowerment and action. In the view that the rise in CO2 emissions has been exponential, we engage the exponential growth of artificial intelligence models to work in concert with individual action, mediated by the circularity accounting model. A model architecture is developed and applied to a case study that involves measuring the movement toward CO2-related planetary boundaries, for one serving of breakfast in the UK.
